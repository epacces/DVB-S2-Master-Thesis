In communication systems, the coding and modulation problem represents the real essence of the reliable communications. The pioneer of the analysis of theoretical aspects of such a problem was Claude E.Shannon, who was able to define mathematically the information and hence to show how it is connected to the problem of establishing a reliable communications between 2 or more points. However, the well known Shannon limit and results related to states the existence of a way to virtually transmit messages with a zero error probability.
